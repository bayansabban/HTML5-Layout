# HTML5-Layout

Older browsers that do not
know the new **HTML5 elements**
will automatically treat them as
inline elements.

**Therefore, to help older browsers:** you should include the line of CSS on the
left which states which new elements should be 
rendered as block-level elements.


# EXTRA MARKUP

Each new version was designed
to be an **improvement** on the
last (*with new elements and
attributes added and older code
removed*).

There have also been several
versions of each browser used to
view web pages, each of which
implements new code.

> Where you should be
particularly aware of browsers
not supporting certain features
